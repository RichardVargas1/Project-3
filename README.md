# Speech Share

* App illustrates a short array, from a seeded database, famous speeches. These speeches have been made in a political, sports or film setting. These speeches will be in text format, as well as video format: linked together. The video format was made possible in thanks to the YouTube API. Along with futhur assistance with the console developers, via Google.

* Future Development: 
- Allowing usersto be able to create a profile. From there, they could share some text of speeches, of a YouTube video. Also, From      there, they will have the option of being able to post these speeches on their profile. Or maybe, share them with other people, if they so wish.

- Being able to store multiple speeches in a single page format. Sort of how like Goggle stores "users also asked for" tabs.

* Technology Stack:
    1. React.js
    2. MongoDB
    3. Express
    4. Node.js
    5. Axios

* Other Tech: YouTube.

* App Updates (As of 2/6/2019)
 - I have abondoned using the ESPN API. According to their website: (http://www.espn.com/static/apis/devcenter/blog/read/publicretirement.html), they will no longer be issuing public API keys.
 - I am able to communicate with YouTube however. That is definitely a plus.
 - App is fully functioning. Able to maneuver about as you please.
